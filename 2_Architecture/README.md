### Sensors:
#### Ultrasonic Sensor: 
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is a sensor used for detecting the distance to an object using sonar.  
### Switch:
#### DPDT Switch: 
A DPDT switch (double-pole, double-throw) is an electromechanical switch that can be formed by adding a pole to the SPDT switch. This is very easy to install because it is available with a locking system that can lock & unlock the switch directly in a remote cabinet without using any Nut-Bolts or screw for fitting
### Actuators:
#### Arduino Buzzer:
A piezo buzzer is basically a tiny speaker that you can connect directly to an Arduino; from the arduino you can make sounds with a buzzer by using tone. 

### Micro controller:
#### Arduino Buzzer::
The Arduino Nano is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board based on the ATmega328P released in 2008. It offers the same connectivity and specs of the Arduino Uno board in a smaller form factor.

The Arduino Nano is equipped with 30 male I/O headers, in a DIP30-like configuration, which can be programmed using the Arduino Software integrated development environment (IDE), which is common to all Arduino boards and running both online and offline. The board can be powered through a type-B mini-USB cable or from a 9 V battery.
### Power supply:
#### 9V Battery:
The battery is used to provide power supply to the system for its operation.
