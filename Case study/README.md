# Washing Machine #
The system should provide fully automatic mode, semi-automatic mode and manual mode. Modes should be selectable by a keypad.

Under fully automatic mode user intervention requirement should be zero. Once the system is started in this mode it should perform its work independently and after the completion of work it should notify the user about the completion of work. This mode instantaneously should sense cloth quality and requirement of water, water temperature, detergent, load, wash cycle time and perform operation accordingly.

In semi-automatic mode also user requirement should be nil. But user has to choose any one of the semi-automatic mode in which washing conditions are predefined. Once the predefined mode is started the system should perform its job and after completion it should inform the user.

In manual mode continuous intervention of user is required. User has to specify which operation he wants to do and has to provide related information to the control system. For example, if user wants to wash only, he has to choose ‘wash’ option in manual mode. Then the system should ask the user to enter the wash time, amount of water and the load. After these data are entered, the user should start the machine. When the specified operation is completed system should inform the user.

When the lid is open system should not work. If door is accidentally opened in between wash operation, then the system should stop working in minimum possible time (<10s)>

The system should provide all basic features of a washing machine like washing, rinsing, spinning, drying, cold wash, hot wash etc.

The system should provide easy options for upgradeability of new features. The hardware and the software should be compatible to both machines, which have fewer features, or more features. Removal of any feature should not affect the working of any other features or overall working of the system.

The system should work on single phase AC from 190VAC to 250VAC. The system should protect itself from power supply voltage variations.

In the event of power failure, the washing machine should automatically start its cycle from the point of interruption when power is resumed.
